The goal of this Web app is to generate donation certificates.
The user should upload an image, an be able to resize and move it inside a specific area in the screen.

Currently the app request from the user two string that will be formatted below the cropped image with the prefixes  "De : " and "Para:  ( donor and receptor )

**I am considering the following improvments**

Perfect choice! Render.com + Python is ideal for your short-term deployment needs.

  Render.com Advantages for Your Use Case:

  - Simple Python deployment (just requirements.txt + main app file)
  - Built-in PostgreSQL database (perfect for token storage)
  - Auto-deploy from GitHub
  - HTTPS included
  - Easy CORS configuration
  - Cost-effective for short-term projects

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Analyze Render.com deployment requirements for token management API
     ☐ Design Python API structure for minimal frontend changes
     ☐ Plan database solution for token storage
     ☐ Define integration points between frontend and API

● Minimal Frontend Changes Approach:

  Just add one JavaScript function to check token on page load:

  // Add to existing JS - checks token before showing certificate UI
  async function validateToken() {
    const token = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get('token');
    if (!token) return redirectToDonation();

    const response = await fetch(`https://your-api.render.com/validate/${token}`);
    if (!response.ok) return redirectToDonation();

    // Token valid - show certificate UI as normal
    enableCertificateGeneration();
  }

● Simple Python Stack:

  Flask + PostgreSQL (Render's managed database):
  - Lightweight and fast to implement
  - Built-in database connection in Render
  - Simple token table: id, token, status, created_at, used_at

  Alternative: FastAPI if you prefer modern async approach, but Flask is simpler for this scope.

● Integration Points:

  1. Page load: Frontend validates token via API call
  2. Download trigger: Frontend calls API to mark token as used
  3. CORS: Configure Render app to allow GitHub Pages origin

  Deployment Steps:
  1. Create Flask app with token API routes
  2. Connect Render PostgreSQL database
  3. Deploy to Render (auto-deploy from Git)
  4. Update frontend with API endpoint URL
  5. Add CORS headers for GitHub Pages domain
